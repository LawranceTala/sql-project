# Database Normalization Assignment

## Project Title
Database Normalization: Achieving 1NF and 2NF

## Description
This project demonstrates the process of database normalization through SQL queries and table restructuring.  
- Question 1 addresses First Normal Form (1NF) by converting multi-valued attributes into atomic values.  
- Question 2 addresses Second Normal Form (2NF) by eliminating partial dependencies and splitting data into multiple tables.

## How to Run / Setup
1. Import the `answers.sql` file into your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or command line).  
2. Execute the queries sequentially.  
3. The script will create the normalized tables and insert data accordingly.
